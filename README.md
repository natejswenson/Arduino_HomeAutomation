# Arduino_HomeAutomation
EtherTen....Fun Side Project WiP just started toying around with this again ultimately this will control my low voltage landscape lights and underground pet fence with a few motions and sensor inputs i addped password protection to the websever; I plan on documenting this further. 
## 1. Materials 

- [Etherten](http://cactus.io/platform/freetronics/freetronics-ether10)
- [5VAC control relay](https://www.robotshop.com/en/sparkfun-beefcake-relay-control-kit-ver-20.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwwMn1BRAUEiwAZ_jnEhJkwqgaFJqPm2Arlk2tpowAWDWjsd8x0cTe9jfhw2knRSiEkBE8qBoCwJ0QAvD_BwE) (3) output from d7 d8 d4 
- Temp outdoor Senosr (1) input to aO
- Temp Indoor Sensor (1) input to a1
- motion Tensor  (1) input to a2
- micro sd card (future) this will allow me to move web files off of arduino

## 2. What Needs to be documented
 - many 
 - things
- .........
